## Description

In this repository, I created a scene where a snowman is refilling their car in a desert rest stop in the middle of nowhere. In the Unity Asset Store, I initially found the snowman asset and knew that I wanted to construct some sort of scene with it. Later, I found an asset pack which contained a bunch of simple dessert assets as well as a racing car asset and I immedietely knew that I wanted to construct a scene of a snowman driving in the desert. I later found a nice bundle of buildings, which contained a gas station that I wanted to include, with the cartoon buildings asset pack, as well as a laptop asset which I included because I thought it might be interesting to include in front of the animal skulls included with the desert pack. The main character in the scene is the snowman, which is also where the 1st person camera lies.
